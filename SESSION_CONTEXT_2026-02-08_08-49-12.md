## Objective
Finalize Phase 1 Analyzer (Scout + Underwriter), add requirements, and produce a human-readable deal memo.

## Changes Made
- Updated `scripts/scout_scrape.py` to robustly set `address` and include `meta` in `analysis.json`.
- Added `scripts/underwriter_calc.py` report generation to output `analysis_report.md` alongside the strict schema JSON.
- Added `requirements.txt` with `requests` and `pandas`.
- Added `deals/active/` and `deals/archive/` directories earlier in the session.

## Notable Implementation Details
- Underwriter writes a strictly compliant `ANALYSIS_SCHEMA` JSON (flat keys), and generates a readable Markdown memo using a derived report view.
- Scout maps Clark County GIS data into the initial `analysis.json` (pre-underwriter), which the Underwriter then normalizes.

## Execution Notes
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` failed due to externally-managed Python environment (PEP 668). Use a venv or `--break-system-packages`.
- Running the Scout against `gis.clark.wa.gov` failed due to DNS resolution (network unavailable in this environment).

## Next Steps
- Re-run `python scripts/scout_scrape.py "5420 NE Fourth Plain Blvd"` with working network.
- Run `python scripts/underwriter_calc.py "5420"` to generate `analysis.json` + `analysis_report.md`.
- Optionally add a venv setup script or instructions.
