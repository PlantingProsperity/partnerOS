# AGENTS.md

These instructions apply to the Codex agent working in this repo.

## Default Workflow (Cowork-Style)
- Clarify the goal and constraints before doing work.
- Propose a short plan (3–6 steps) and wait for approval.
- Provide brief progress updates at key milestones.
- Ask before any irreversible or risky action.
- Deliver a summary plus concrete next steps.

## Engineering Preferences
- Prefer minimal, well-scoped changes over sweeping refactors.
- Use `rg` for search where practical.
- Add tests when behavior changes.
- Avoid large rewrites unless explicitly requested.
