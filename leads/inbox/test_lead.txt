Subject: Fwd: Mom's house
From: Mike S. <mike@example.com>

Hi Dan,
My brother mentioned you buy houses. We are trying to settle the estate.
The address is 3409 M St, Vancouver, WA 98663.
It's got a lot of deferred maintenance, roof is shot.
We just want to be done with it, probate is dragging on.
Call me at 360-555-0199.
- Mike
