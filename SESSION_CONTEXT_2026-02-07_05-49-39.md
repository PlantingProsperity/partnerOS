## Objective
Design a multi-agent AI-native digital real estate back-office for two new Washington State agents (Weichert Realtors) using Gemini as the Office Manager, with strong compliance and auditability.

## Environment Snapshot (Confirmed)
- OS: Debian 13 (trixie), GNOME 48.7, Wayland.
- Tools: codex CLI, gemini CLI, python3, node/npm, git, rg, rclone, podman, docker, docker-compose, catt, mkchromecast.
- Services: rclone-drive enabled; podman services available (disabled).

## Artifacts Created/Updated
- MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md (updated plan overview with Gemini Office Manager, hiring via markdown, strict Deal Schema, stronger guardrails, expanded roadmap).
- DEAL_SCHEMA.md (detailed Deal Schema with stages/triggers, required fields, compliance, audit, validation and defaults).
- LEAD_SCHEMA.md (lead intake schema).
- ANALYSIS_SCHEMA.md (underwriting schema, Pinneo methodology, optional development/zoning section).
- CASE_SCHEMA.md (unified operational case schema with audit/history).

## Key Decisions
- Gemini is the digital Office Manager and interface between the AI-native office and the two principals.
- Lead and Analysis are upstream modular objects; Deal is instantiated only upon decision to draft an offer.
- Strict Deal Schema is the single source of truth for transaction state.
- Unified Case lifecycle across all ops case types; use sub_status/tags for nuances.

## Deal Stages And Triggers (Washington Investment Brokerage)
1. Drafting/Structuring
- Trigger: Decision to make an offer (promoted from Analysis).
2. Negotiation
- Trigger: Sending the signed Offer (PSA) to Seller/Listing Agent.
3. Mutual Acceptance (Clock Starts)
- Trigger: PSA fully signed and dated by both parties.
4. Feasibility/Due Diligence
- Trigger: Earnest Money received (Form 31) or Escrow opened.
5. Funding/Partner Alignment
- Trigger: Inspection Contingency waived/satisfied (Form 35R).
6. Escrow/Closing Prep
- Trigger: Funding committed or Loan Docs ordered.
7. Closed
- Trigger: Recording Numbers received from County.
8. Post-Close/Asset Mgmt
- Trigger: Possession/Keys received.

## Critical Deadlines (Deal)
- Earnest Money Deposit: default mutual acceptance + 2 business days.
- Seller Disclosure Review: default mutual acceptance + 3 business days.
- Inspection Response: default mutual acceptance + 10 days.
- Title Review: default receipt + 5 business days.
- Financing Contingency: Form 22A deadline.
- Hard Money/Private Capital Commitment Date: custom investor deadline.

## Lead Schema (LEAD_SCHEMA.md)
- Lifecycle: New -> Attempted Contact -> Connected -> Nurture -> Qualified -> Dead/Archived.
- Required fields: identity, contact, property context (optional), story (Pinneo), ops fields.

## Analysis Schema (ANALYSIS_SCHEMA.md)
- Groups: valuation/market data, project costs, investment metrics, creative finance, decision output.
- Optional development/zoning section.

## Case Schema (CASE_SCHEMA.md)
- Types: Maintenance, Tenant_Request, Vendor_Job, Finance_Ops, Compliance_Review, Marketing_Task.
- Lifecycle: New -> Triage -> In_Progress -> Blocked -> Review -> Resolved.
- Required fields + context objects + audit/history.

## Guardrail Direction
- Strong compliance, dual review for legal/financial outputs.
- Immutable audit trails and human approval for high-risk actions.

## Next Steps (Pending)
- Decide which section to formalize next: Guardrails, Agent Team, or Implementation Roadmap.
- Optional: clean up CASE_SCHEMA interaction_log formatting to be structurally grouped.
