## Objective
Capture the Bret Taylor-aligned “Sovereign State” pivot and formalize the Agent Team roster.

## Artifacts Created/Updated
- SOVEREIGN_STATE.md: New blueprint for state-first architecture, no-dashboard interface, deterministic core, and event-driven workflow.
- AGENT_ROSTER.md: New roster with agent roles and state ownership.

## Sovereign State Highlights
- State is sovereign; agents mutate database state rather than chat with each other.
- No UI dashboard; Manager is interface via chat commands.
- Underwriter uses hard-coded scripts for math; LLM manages I/O only.
- Janitor/Coordinator acts as state garbage collector.

## Agent Roster (State Ownership)
- Manager: Owns master status and orchestration.
- Underwriter: Owns financials table; runs deterministic scripts.
- Planner: Owns regulatory table (zoning, setbacks, allowable uses).
- Scout: Owns property specs (sq_ft, lot_size, year_built).
- Profiler: Owns seller profile (motivation, leverage).
- Scribe: Owns interaction log (transcription and synthesis).
- Librarian: Owns document index (files tagged to deals).
- Janitor: Owns system health and stale deal cleanup.

## Next Step
Define allowed actions/tools for each agent, starting with the Manager.
